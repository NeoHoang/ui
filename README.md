## Third party libraries

### leaflet-hash.js

Michael Evan's excellent [leaflet-hash](https://github.com/mlevans/leaflet-hash) library, which addresses point #1 on [Stamen's Checklist for Maps](http://content.stamen.com/stamens-checklist-for-maps), is a core part of map UI for every Mapzen demo. [There is now a public CDN for this library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/leaflet-hash), and you can also [install as an npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-hash).
