#Common terms and writing conventions

In general, defer to the dictionary, such as merriam-webster, or the Microsoft Manual of Style and the (Apple Style Guide)[https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf]

This list is a living document that will be added to or changed as terminology is encountered.

##Numbers
- Spell out one through nine unless it precedes a unit or is to be input, write the numerals for 10 and above.

##Computing terms
- You "sign in" or "sign off" when accessing an account. You "log on" or "log out" of a operating system session.
- Hosting within your organization is "on-premises". It always has a hyphen and an -s.
- email is one word, no hyphen.
- File format abbreviations (PDF, JPEG) should be in uppercase, and filename extensions (.pdf, .jpeg) in lowercase.
- filename is one word
- Finder is the application for browsing folders on a Mac. Apple says to use it as "the Finder", not "Finder".
- administrator should not be shortened to "admin"

##Abbreviations and acronyms
- Spell out a term if you think the audience does not know it. Put the spelled-out term first and the acronym in parentheses, such as Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- Do not add an apostrophe if you make acronym plural (for example, DVDs not DVD's).
- Abbreviate MB and GB

##Titles and headings
- Use sentence-style capitalization (First word capitalized), rather than title case (All Words Capitalized). Sentence-style is easier to read.
- Use imperative verbs, rather than gerunds for titles and headings. For example, name a section, "Add a point to the map", rather than "Adding a point to the map". Imperative is clearer and easier to translate. 

##Common words
- Because, since - use because for causation (because you checked your email, you saw the meeting invitation) and since for a period of time (been hours since you checked email)
