#Guidelines for writing tutorials

These are some suggestions for writing tutorials or "how to" documents. Some guidelines may not apply to your product or workflow.

##Introduction:
In the first few paragraphs, introduce the topic and provide an overview of the workflow to be performed.
- A requirements section or a clear, bullet list of what is needed to complete the tutorial.
- An estimate of how long it will take to complete the tutorial.
- What level of knowledge is expected.

###Guidance for requirements
- A specific list of software or hardware requirements, including software or API release numbers.
- Indicate any required operating system or machine configuration. For example, if the steps are written for Mac, but someone could likely follow along on Windows, say so. Also indicate the development tools or environments required.
- Indicate whether Internet access is required, especially if you need to have it consistently through the exercises or if you need to download large volumes of data. Some users will want to do tutorials in disconnected environments (airplanes, subways), while others may be in developing regions and lack continuous high-speed networks.
- List any additional accounts, such as GitHub, or permissions that are necessary.

##General thoughts
- Make the tutorial approachable.
- Do not assume prior knowledge, and if you do, be very clear about what what you are assuming and provide links to resources for more information. For example, if you have established that some knowledge of GitHub workflows is required, include a link to the GitHub documentation.
- Do not start with a block of command line text. Many README files on GitHub are notorious for this, and it is very offputting to non-developers or even experienced developers who are new to an environment or language.
